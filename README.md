# This repository provides a deep dive into regression analysis, covering both theoretical concepts and hands-on coding exercises. 
# Topics include linear regression assumptions, error metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE), multicollinearity, feature selection, and model evaluation. 
# Practical implementations include visualizing residuals, polynomial regression, machine learning pipelines, and advanced regression techniques like Ridge regression. 
# Additionally, it explores model serialization using Pickle and Joblib.
